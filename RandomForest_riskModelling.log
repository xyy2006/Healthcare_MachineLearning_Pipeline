Launching java with spark-submit command /home/ec2-user/spark-1.5.0//bin/spark-submit   sparkr-shell /tmp/RtmpNpRSdn/backend_port4e571b454544 
Start loading input_file! 
Start factors_details_file! 
Start extracting response variables information! 
Start extracting knowledge_driven/data_driven factors information! 
All extracted variables are validated to exsit in data_input! 
We have response_variables are: LOS TOTCHG DIED 
We have knowledge_driven_factors are: AGE FEMALE Homeless RACE 
We have data_driven_factors are: ASOURCE ATYPE DISPUNIFORM HCUP_ED HCUP_OS MEDINCSTQ ... 
Dropping data_driven_factors which have NA_ratio > 15%! 
Number of data_driven_factors before NA_ratio pruning: 24 
Number of data_driven_factors after NA_ratio pruning: 24 
Now running Predictive_module: RandomForest
